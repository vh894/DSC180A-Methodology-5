**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic I learned was all the various factors that influence where EV charging stations are located. I discovered that the proximity of a charger’s location with places like transit stops, highways, parking lots, and schools were some of the most common areas for charging stations. I used to think the average income of an area would be a primary factor that influenced where EV chargers were but based on our EDA results, we noticed that this doesn’t happen to be the case. It was also interesting to see the different considerations when constructing a charger. For example, some EV chargers are made on parking lot islands rather than directly into the parking lot ground because it costs less to dig in the dirt than it does in concrete.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Something I want to investigate is finding a better way to report broken EV chargers. One of the main problems that SDGE faces with EV charges is that it’s difficult to detect when a charger needs repairs because they don’t have employees who constantly monitor the chargers. The chargers only get fixed if someone coincidently spots the broken charging station and files a report about it. With all the EV chargers around San Diego, there will be some broken chargers that will be missed. I was thinking of implementing a computer vision model that can detect when a charger is broken so that the chargers can be fixed promptly.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One change that I would make to my approach for my Quarter 1 Project is that I would look more into other potential factors that could influence the location of EV chargers besides just the proximity of the charging station’s location to certain things. For example, I could’ve performed some EDA to see if chargers are more prevalent in well-lit areas. People often feel unsafe if an area doesn’t have many lights at night, which means that they probably won’t use any chargers within those areas. It would be interesting to see how this factor influences the location of EV chargers.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
A technique that I’m interested in learning more about is computer vision. I’ve never done anything with computer vision before but it is something that I want to learn more about. I hope to use computer vision in our project so that I can gain more exposure to this machine learning technique.
